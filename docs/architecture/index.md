# Platform Architecture

Understanding TESâ©“IoT's architecture is key to leveraging its full potential.

## Architecture Components

- **[Overview](overview.md)** - High-level system architecture
- **[Core Concepts](core-concepts.md)** - Fundamental concepts and terminology
- **[System Design](system-design.md)** - Design principles and patterns
- **[Data Flow](data-flow.md)** - How data moves through the system
- **[Security Model](security-model.md)** - Zero Trust security architecture
- **[Scalability](scalability.md)** - Scaling strategies and patterns

## Key Design Principles

1. **Security First** - Zero Trust architecture with PKI
2. **Scalability** - Handle millions of devices
3. **Extensibility** - Plugin architecture for customization
4. **Reliability** - 99.99% uptime SLA
5. **Performance** - Sub-5ms API response times
